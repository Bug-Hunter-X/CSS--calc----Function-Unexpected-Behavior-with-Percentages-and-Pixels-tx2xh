The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error: unexpected behavior when using the `calc()` function with percentages and multiple units.

```css
.container {
  width: 50%;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 2px solid black;
}

.inner {
  width: calc(100% - 20px);
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```

In this example, one might expect `.inner` to have a width of 80% of the container's width (100% - 20px padding). However, the `calc()` function's subtraction of `20px` is relative to the computed width of `.inner`, not the container.

This behavior can be counter-intuitive, particularly when working with responsive layouts or nested elements.
